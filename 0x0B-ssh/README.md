# ALX System Engineering & DevOps - SSH Project

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum and focuses on SSH (Secure Shell) fundamentals. The project aims to enhance your understanding of servers, SSH, RSA key pair creation, connecting to remote hosts, and SSH configuration. By completing this project, you'll gain practical experience in managing SSH connections securely.

### Curriculum Details

- **SE Foundations Average**: 83.44%
- **Module**: 0x0B. SSH
- **Topics**: DevOps, SSH, Network, SysAdmin, Security
- **Weight**: 1
- **Project Duration**: Apr 19, 2024, 6:00 AM - Apr 22, 2024, 6:00 AM

## Background Context

In this project, you'll work with an Ubuntu server hosted remotely. You'll connect to this server using SSH with an RSA key instead of a password. Your server details are provided in the "my servers" section of your intranet profile.

## Resources

- **Read or Watch**:
  - What is a (physical) server - text and video formats
  - SSH essentials
  - SSH Config File
  - Public Key Authentication for SSH
  - How Secure Shell Works
  - SSH Crash Course (Recommended at x1.25 speed or above)

- **For Reference**:
  - Understanding the SSH Encryption and Connection Process
  - Secure Shell Wiki
  - IETF RFC 4251 (SSH Protocol Description)
  - Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Documentation

- **Man or Help**:
  - `ssh`
  - `ssh-keygen`
  - `env`

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to explain:
- What a server is and where they are typically located
- The concept of SSH and how it works
- Creating an SSH RSA key pair
- Connecting to a remote host using SSH RSA keys
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

## Copyright & Plagiarism

- You must solve the tasks independently to meet the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpretation**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **Executable Scripts**: All Bash scripts must be executable
- **Script Headers**: Scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` followed by a comment explaining their purpose

## Tasks Overview

1. **Use a private key**: Write a Bash script to connect to your server using an SSH private key.
2. **Create an SSH key pair**: Script to create an RSA key pair.
3. **Client configuration file**: Configure SSH client to use a private key and refuse password authentication.
4. **Let me in!**: Add a provided SSH public key to the server for external access.
