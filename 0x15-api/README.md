# 0x15. API

## Description

This project involves creating Python scripts to access employee data via an API, organizing the data, and exporting it to various data structures. This task exemplifies the advantages of using Python over Bash scripting for system administration tasks. By the end of this project, you should have a deeper understanding of APIs, REST APIs, microservices, and how to handle data in CSV and JSON formats.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

### General
- Why Bash scripting is not suitable for certain tasks
- What an API is
- What a REST API is
- What microservices are
- The CSV format
- The JSON format

### Pythonic Style
- Package and module name style
- Class name style
- Variable name style
- Function name style
- Constant name style
- Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Libraries in Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A `README.md` file is mandatory
- Code should adhere to `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- Use `get` to access dictionary values to avoid exceptions if the key does not exist
- Ensure code is not executed when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

## Resources

- [What is an API](https://example.com)
- [What is an API? In English, please](https://example.com)
- [What is a REST API](https://example.com)
- [What are microservices](https://example.com)

## Project Tasks

1. **Task 0**: Gather data from an API
2. **Task 1**: Export data in CSV format
3. **Task 2**: Export data in JSON format
4. **Task 3**: Additional task (if any)

Each task will involve writing Python scripts that follow the requirements and utilize best practices in coding and documentation.

## Execution

Make sure that your Python scripts are executable. You can make a file executable by running:
```bash
chmod +x filename.py
```

## Testing

Ensure your code is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.5. Use the `pycodestyle` tool to check your code style:
```bash
pycodestyle your_script.py
```

## Submission

Your submission should include:
- Python scripts for each task
- A `README.md` file
- Documentation for each module

## Plagiarism

Remember, plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program. All solutions must be your own work.

## Conclusion

This project will help you understand the importance and usage of APIs, and enhance your Python scripting skills, especially in data handling and exporting to different formats. Happy coding!
