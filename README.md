# Project: Web Stack Debugging #0

## Description

This project is part of the Web Stack Debugging series, focusing on training individuals in the art of debugging. As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, debugging skills are crucial, and this project aims to enhance those skills through practical exercises.

## Background Context

The task involves fixing a broken web stack by identifying and resolving issues manually before creating a Bash script to automate the fix. The example given requires ensuring that the server has a copy of the `/etc/passwd` file in `/tmp` and a file named `/tmp/isworking` containing the string "OK."
