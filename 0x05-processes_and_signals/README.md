# Project Title: Processes and Signals

This project focuses on understanding processes and signals in the context of system engineering and DevOps, with an emphasis on Bash scripting. It includes a series of tasks aimed at enhancing knowledge and proficiency in process management, signal handling, and Bash scripting. Below is a detailed overview of the project structure, objectives, requirements, and tasks.

## Overview

The project covers essential concepts such as PID (Process ID), process management, signals, and Bash scripting. Through a series of tasks, participants will gain hands-on experience in writing Bash scripts to manage processes, handle signals, and perform system-level operations.

## Project Details

- **Author:** NSANZIMANA RUGWIRO Dominique Parfait

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Explain the concept of PID and its significance.
- Understand the basics of processes and their management in Linux.
- Handle signals effectively within Bash scripts.
- Demonstrate proficiency in Bash scripting for system automation and administration tasks.

### Resources

Participants are encouraged to read or watch materials on the following topics:

- Linux PID
- Linux process
- Linux signal
- Process management in Linux

Additionally, they should refer to `man` pages for commands such as `ps`, `pgrep`, `pkill`, `kill`, `exit`, and `trap`.

### Copyright and Plagiarism

- Participants must come up with solutions for the tasks independently to meet the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism in any form is strictly prohibited and may result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Platform:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line.
- **Executable Scripts:** All Bash script files must be executable.
- **Shellcheck:** Scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without errors.
- **Shebang Line:** The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- **README.md:** A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.

## Tasks

The project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of process management, signal handling, or Bash scripting. Each task has its requirements and objectives.

1. **What is my PID**
   - Write a Bash script to display its own PID.

2. **List your processes**
   - Write a Bash script to display a list of currently running processes.

3. **Show your Bash PID**
   - Write a Bash script to display lines containing the word "bash", revealing the PID of the Bash process.

4. **To infinity and beyond**
   - Write a Bash script to display "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely with a sleep interval.

5. **Don't stop me now!**
   - Write a Bash script to stop the "To infinity and beyond" process.

6. **Stop me if you can**
   - Write a Bash script to stop the "To infinity and beyond" process without using `kill` or `killall`.

7. **Highlander**
   - Write a Bash script to display "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely with a sleep interval, and respond to SIGTERM signal with "I am invincible!!!".

8. **Beheaded process**
   - Write a Bash script to kill the "Highlander" process.
