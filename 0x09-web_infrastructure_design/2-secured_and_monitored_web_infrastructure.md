# a flowchart representation of the secured and monitored three-server web infrastructure:

1. **Start**: User wants to access the website www.foobar.com securely.

2. **DNS Resolution**: DNS resolves www.foobar.com to the load balancer's IP (e.g., 10.0.0.1).

3. **Load Balancer Handling**: HAProxy load balancer manages incoming requests and distributes them to the web servers.

4. **Traffic Encryption**: SSL certificate installed on the load balancer ensures HTTPS encryption for secure communication.

5. **Web Server Processing**: Nginx web servers receive encrypted requests from the load balancer.

6. **Firewall Protection**: Each server is protected by a firewall to control incoming and outgoing network traffic, enhancing security.
    - **Firewalls**: Added to prevent unauthorized access, protect against cyber threats, and enforce network security policies.

7. **Application Processing**: Nginx forwards requests to the application server for processing.

8. **Database Interaction**: Application server interacts with the MySQL database for data retrieval and storage.

9. **Monitoring Setup**:
    - **Monitoring Clients**: Three monitoring clients (e.g., SumoLogic) installed on each server collect performance and system metrics.
    - **Monitoring Purpose**: Used to track server health, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues proactively.
    - **Data Collection**: Monitoring tools collect data such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, network traffic, and application performance metrics.
    
10. **Monitoring QPS**:
    - **To Monitor QPS**: Configure monitoring tools to track queries per second (QPS) metrics for the web server.
    - **Analysis and Alerting**: Set up alerts for abnormal spikes or drops in QPS to identify potential performance issues.

11. **Response Generation**: Application server generates dynamic responses.

12. **Response Delivery**: Encrypted responses are sent back to the Nginx web servers.

13. **Response to User**: Nginx web servers deliver encrypted responses to the user's browser.

14. **End**: User receives the securely delivered website content.

#### Additional Notes:

- **Firewalls**: Implemented to control network traffic and protect servers from unauthorized access or malicious attacks.
- **HTTPS Encryption**: Traffic served over HTTPS to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.
- **Monitoring**: Essential for proactive system management, performance optimization, and timely issue resolution.
- **SSL Termination Issue**: Terminating SSL at the load balancer may expose decrypted traffic within the internal network, posing a security risk.
- **Single MySQL Server Issue**: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure for database operations.
- **Uniform Server Components Issue**: Having servers with identical components increases the risk of systemic failures or vulnerabilities affecting the entire infrastructure.

This flowchart demonstrates the flow of requests, encryption, and monitoring in the secured and monitored three-server web infrastructure, emphasizing security measures, HTTPS encryption, and proactive monitoring for enhanced reliability and performance.
