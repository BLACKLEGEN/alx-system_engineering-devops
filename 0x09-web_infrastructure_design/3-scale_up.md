1. **User Interaction**:
   - You open your web browser and type www.funworld.com into the address bar.

2. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Your browser sends a request to the DNS (Domain Name System) to find the IP address associated with www.funworld.com.
   - The DNS server responds with the IP address of the load balancer cluster for the FunWorld website.

3. **Load Balancer Cluster**:
   - The request reaches the load balancer cluster, which consists of multiple load balancers working together.
   - One of the load balancers receives your request and decides which web server to forward it to based on factors like server health and current load.

4. **Web Servers**:
   - The load balancer directs your request to one of the web servers dedicated to hosting the FunWorld website.
   - These web servers serve as the front-end of the website, handling incoming requests and delivering static content like images, CSS files, and JavaScript scripts directly to your browser.

5. **Application Servers**:
   - If your request requires dynamic content, such as personalized recommendations or ticket availability, the web server forwards it to one of the application servers.
   - Application servers are responsible for executing the complex logic behind the website, processing user requests, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content.

6. **Database Interaction**:
   - Application servers interact with the database server, which stores all the information about FunWorld's attractions, ticket prices, opening hours, and user data.
   - They retrieve relevant data from the database to personalize your experience on the website or provide up-to-date information about the park.

7. **Response Generation**:
   - Based on the data retrieved from the database and the logic executed by the application servers, a response is generated.
   - This response could be a webpage displaying opening hours, attraction details, ticket prices, or any other information you requested.

8. **Response Delivery**:
   - The response is sent back through the same pathway: from the application server to the web server, then to the load balancer, and finally back to your web browser.

9. **User Receives Response**:
   - Your web browser receives the response from the web server via the load balancer and displays the FunWorld website content.
   - You can now see the opening hours, attractions, ticket prices, and other information you were looking for.

This scenario simplifies the complex web infrastructure of the FunWorld website into a relatable story, making it easier for anyone to understand and draw.
