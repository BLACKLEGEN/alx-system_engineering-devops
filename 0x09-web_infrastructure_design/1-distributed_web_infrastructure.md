# a flowchart representation of the three-server web infrastructure design:

1. **Start**: User wants to access the website www.foobar.com.

2. **DNS Resolution**: DNS resolves www.foobar.com to the load balancer's IP (e.g., 10.0.0.1).

3. **Load Balancer Distribution**: HAProxy load balancer distributes incoming requests to the two web servers based on a round-robin distribution algorithm.

4. **Web Server Processing**: Nginx web servers receive requests from the load balancer.

5. **Application Processing**: Nginx forwards requests to the application server.

6. **Execute Application Logic**: Application server executes the application logic.

7. **Database Interaction**: Application server interacts with the MySQL database.

8. **Primary-Replica Cluster**: MySQL database operates in a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster configuration.
    - **Primary Node**: Handles write operations and serves as the primary source of data.
    - **Replica Node**: Synchronizes data from the primary node and handles read operations, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.

9. **Response Generation**: Application server generates dynamic responses.

10. **Response Delivery**: Responses are sent back to the Nginx web servers.

11. **Response to User**: Nginx web servers deliver responses to the user's browser.

12. **End**: User receives the website content.

#### Additional Notes:

- **Load Balancer**: Added for distributing incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Multiple Servers**: Deployed to prevent a single point of failure (SPOF) and handle increased traffic loads efficiently.
- **Primary-Replica Cluster**: Implemented to ensure data redundancy, fault tolerance, and scalability for the database.
- **Security Considerations**: Firewall configurations, HTTPS encryption, and monitoring tools should be implemented to address security concerns and prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
- **Monitoring**: Essential for detecting and resolving issues promptly, ensuring the stability and performance of the web infrastructure.

This flowchart illustrates the flow of requests and interactions between components in the three-server web infrastructure, highlighting the addition of the load balancer, multiple servers, and a primary-replica database cluster to address scalability, fault tolerance, and performance requirements.
