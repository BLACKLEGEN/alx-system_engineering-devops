# a step-by-step flowchart representation of the one-server web infrastructure design:

1. **Start**: User wants to access the website www.foobar.com.

2. **Check DNS Resolution**: DNS resolves www.foobar.com to server IP (8.8.8.8).

3. **User Request**: User sends an HTTP request to www.foobar.com.

4. **Web Server Receives Request**: Nginx web server on the server receives the request.

5. **Application Processing**: Nginx forwards the request to the application server.

6. **Execute Application Logic**: Application server executes the application logic.

7. **Database Interaction**: Application server interacts with the MySQL database for data retrieval or storage.

8. **Generate Response**: Application server generates a dynamic response.

9. **Response Sent**: Dynamic content is sent back to the Nginx web server.

10. **Response Delivery**: Nginx delivers the response to the user's browser.

11. **End**: User receives the website content.

#### Additional Notes:

- Ensure proper security measures, backups, and monitoring to mitigate risks associated with a single-server infrastructure.
- Consider implementing redundancy and load balancing for improved availability and scalability in future iterations.

This flowchart provides a visual representation of how the components interact in the one-server web infrastructure design, from user request to response delivery, along with additional notes for consideration.
